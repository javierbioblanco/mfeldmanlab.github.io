I am a second-year PhD student in the Feldman lab. My research focuses on the cultural evolution of conformist and anti-conformist transmission, and gene-culture co-evolution of altruism. I received my Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution from UCLA in 2014. There, I researched foraging behaviors in ants, birdsong syntax, and human morality. I am supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

## Javier Blanco Portillo
##### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JavierBioBlanco) | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4bo4uK8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)

Javier graduated from the Undergraduate [Program in Genomic Sciences](https://twitter.com/lcgunam?lang=en) at UNAM in 2016, and from the [Integrative Biology Masters](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/en/) program at LANGEBIO, Cinvestav in 2019. Here, he joined [Andrés Moreno's lab](https://www.morenolab.org) to answer historical questions with population genetics data from underrepresented populations, particularly from the Americas and the Pacific.

As a Biology PhD student at the Feldman Lab, Javier aims to develop tools that can facilitate the integration of different levels of human diversity aiding in questions related to human evolution, genomic relationships among  populations, and complex disease.
