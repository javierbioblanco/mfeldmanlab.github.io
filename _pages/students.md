I am a second-year PhD student in the Feldman lab. My research focuses on the cultural evolution of conformist and anti-conformist transmission, and gene-culture co-evolution of altruism.

I am supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

Now, at the Feldman Lab, Javier aims to contribute to the development of tools that
